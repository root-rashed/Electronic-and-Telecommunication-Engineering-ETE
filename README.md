# üì° Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering (ETE)

This repository contains networking and telecommunication-related projects, focusing on **Cisco Packet Tracer** simulations, **network design**, and **routing concepts**.  
Each `.pkt` file represents a hands-on lab experiment demonstrating different networking topologies and routing configurations.
